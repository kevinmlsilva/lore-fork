/// Enforces partition access for every RPC at the service level, so no
/// handler can forget the check.
///
/// The validator works with the JWT interceptor. The interceptor
/// verifies the token and inserts it as extensions, this service reads them.
/// The validator takes the partition from the request metadata and asks the
/// configured [`RepositoryAuthorizer`] whether the caller may reach it.
/// Returns [`no_repository_access_status`] on denial.
///
/// The check lives here rather than in the interceptor because
/// tonic's `Interceptor::call` is synchronous and cannot await an online
/// authorizer. A tower `Service` can be async.
///
/// Fine-grained per-method permissions can be done in the handlers. To spare
/// the handler a second authorizer round trip, the layer asks the authorizer
/// to enumerate the caller's grants
/// ([`granted_actions`](RepositoryAuthorizer::granted_actions)): when it
/// can, reachability is answered from the enumeration and the enumeration is
/// exposed to the handler as a [`PartitionGrants`] extension. An authorizer
/// that cannot enumerate is asked the plain reachability question
/// (`action: None`) instead. Handlers make their checks through
/// `RepositoryAuthorizer::permits`, which consumes the exposed grants and
/// falls back to a per-action authorizer call when they are absent.
///
/// Checks that depend on the request body stay in handlers, since that's the
/// only place the body is decoded. All such calls still use the common
/// [`RepositoryAuthorizer`], so that all the authorization decisions are done
/// using the same logic.
///
/// A caller with no verified token (the interceptor stands aside on a
/// no-auth server) is still the authorizer's reachability question, but is
/// exposed no grants even when the authorizer enumerates some: grants are the
/// caller's, and `permits` grants nothing without a verified token. The QUIC
/// connect and the HTTP middleware enumerate behind a verified token only,
/// and this keeps the three entry points agreeing that an allow-all verdict
/// opens a no-auth server's partitions without elevating anonymous callers
/// to its privileged actions.
///
/// The layer bounds its own authorization stage and nothing else. The inner
/// service is entered unbounded, because tonic decodes the request body
/// inside it: a bound spanning that decode expires on a client that is slow
/// to finish sending and attributes the stall to the server, under a status
/// that counts as a server error. Each handler behind this layer times out
/// the work it owns, which is the bound that keeps a request below the load
/// balancer's ceiling.
