//! The local store's load-driven garbage collection trigger.
//!
//! Loading more of a store than its configured size cap starts a compaction pass without an
//! explicit `repository gc`. The pass is spawned detached and reports through the sink bound at
//! the moment it fired, so it only reports if it outlives whatever triggered it: a process that
//! exits promptly asks the pass to stop, and `compact_packfiles` checks that request twice
//! before reporting anything. This runs the trigger in a process that stays alive and waits for
//! the report, so the assertion is about the trigger rather than about who wins that race.
//!
//! Its own test target: [`lore_storage::gc_event::set_gc_event_sink_provider`] takes the first
//! registration process-wide, and `lore-revision` registers its own on the first client store
//! open, so a sink installed from inside the shared suite binary would be used or ignored
//! depending on test order.
