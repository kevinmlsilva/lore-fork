//! Timing for descending a large tree, the two ways a walk can ask the filter.
//!
//! Both strategies are timed in one binary over one tree, so the difference is
//! the filter call and nothing else -- no build, allocator or layout variance
//! between them:
//!
//! - **whole path**: `excludes_tree` per node, which is what every walk did
//!   before the descent split. It folds the node's ancestors, taking the shared
//!   part from the [`AncestorMemo`], then steps the last component.
//! - **threaded**: `child_excludes_tree` per node, carrying the parent's
//!   `FilterStates` down. One step, no fold, no memo.
//!
//! Both walks prune a directory on the same verdict and count the same files;
//! the run asserts that before reporting either number.
//!
//! Run with:
//!     `cargo test -p lore-revision --release --test filter_descend_bench -- --nocapture`
