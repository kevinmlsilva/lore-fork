"""Generate the gitignore ground-truth table used by
`lore-revision/tests/filter_gitignore.rs`.

Ground truth comes from git itself, never from a reading of the spec. Each case
gets a throwaway repository: the patterns are written to `.gitignore`, a fixed
tree is materialized, and `git status --porcelain -uall` is asked which paths
survive. Whatever git reports as untracked is included; everything else git
ignores. That single answer folds in pattern matching, anchoring, last-match
wins and the pruning of excluded directories.

Coverage is combinatorial rather than hand-picked: `*` and `**` and partial
wildcards appear in leading, interior and trailing component positions, at every
depth the tree supports, alone and paired with re-inclusions in both orders, and
in alternating exclude/re-include chains.
