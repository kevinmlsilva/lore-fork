"""Smoke tests for parallel multi-path staging.

Builds directory trees two and three levels deep (into the thousands of files
and directories) and stages large, overlapping explicit path sets — with and without ``--scan``,
across add / modify / delete — to exercise the parallel-staging path: input
normalization (antichain collapse of overlapping paths), pre-creation of shared
ancestor directories a depth at a time, and the parallel per-target fan-out.

Every operation is verified against the exact expected staged set via ``--json``
status: precisely the files and directories expected, each with the expected
node type and action, with no duplicates, extras, or omissions.
