"""Minimal gRPC client for the server's AdminService.ServerInfo RPC.

The server reports the cargo features it was compiled with via
`ServerInfoResponse.features`. Tests that depend on an optional feature (for
example `failure_generator`, which enables fault injection) use this to skip
cleanly when run against a server that wasn't built with the feature.

We avoid generated protobuf stubs: `ServerInfoRequest` is empty (zero bytes on
the wire) and we only need the repeated-string `features` field (field 2), so we
serialize an empty request and read that one field back with `protobuf_wire`.
The gRPC AdminService is registered without an auth interceptor and the test
server runs gRPC in plaintext, so an insecure channel with no metadata works.
