"""Comprehensive smoke tests for dirty-tracking interactions.

Covers file and directory dirty tracking, status and status --scan, stage and
stage --scan, and their interactions with reset, commit, branch switch, sync,
branch merge, cherry-pick and revert across added / modified / deleted files
and multi-level directories.

All tests use --json structured output parsed by parse_status_json and validate
the full set of reported file/directory states (path, action, flagDirty,
flagStaged) after and between operations.

Assertions encode the intended behavior and validate the full reported
file/directory state after each operation.
